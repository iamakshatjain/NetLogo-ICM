# NetLogo - ICM

SNA ( social network analysis ) project : Independent Cascade Modelling (ICM) on Scale-Free network with NetLogo


 - Creating a scale free model with NetLogo
 - Applying ICM (Independent Cascade Model) to find the maximum number steps required to get to the maximum number of nodes.
 - Repeating 5 times by starting from different nodes and see how many steps are required for the above
	 - Activation probabilities for the pair of nodes which is needed for ICM are assigned randomly
